# Pre-Work-Study-Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? 

My motivation for this Study Guide was to put all that I have learned in the bootcamp onto a guide to study for later. I built this project to have something to look back to while studying and having a guided reference will be beneficial. The problem this project solves is having a study reference with all the key points I need to be successful in this bootcamp. I have learned the basics of web literacy, HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as Git and navigating the command line.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
